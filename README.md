#WEATHER APP

## Description

The Weather App is an app that displays the current weather and 5-Day forecast for a city that is searched for in the search bar. 

Additionally, the last city you searched for will populate on the page as well.


## Actual Behavior to Be Corrected

This app is in the stages of completion and will be complete upon the following:

* Proper integration of dayjs
* Using setItem, getItem, and JSON parsing to access local storage
* the proper display of icons and 5-Day forecast cards
* enabling the API to retrieve information for any city searched, rather than simply Austin, Texas.
* programming the API to present units in imperal measurements
* clean and attractive display formatting using Bootstrap and CSS
*
